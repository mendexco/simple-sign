## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mendexco/simple-sign.git
cd simple-sign
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root, following the scheme of .env.example.
Some variables need to be created outside, like the OAuth ones.

### 4. üê≥ Docker Setup
This step is necessary for local postgresdb setup.
```bash
docker compose -up -d
```

### 5. Prisma Setup
```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 6. Start Dev Server
```bash
bun dev
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Main Challenges

- Handling PDF exhibition in a user-friendly way
- Ensuring robust session/auth flows with NextAuth across routes
- Organizing shared logic across pages and components effectively
- Setting up HeroUI (took too long to discover it was Tailwind version)
- Learning and using the app folder instead of pages folder
